## WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LEMP STACK) IN AWS

### Introduction:

**LEMP** is an open-source web application stack used to develop web applications. The term LEMP is an acronym that represents L for the Linux Operating system, Nginx (pronounced as engine-x, hence the E in the acronym) web server, M for MySQL database, and P for PHP scripting language.

LEMP Stands For:
- L- Linux Operating System
- E- Nginx Server
- M- MySQL Database
- P- PHP

LEMP benefits from strong community support and is employed globally in numerous highly-scaled web applications. Nginx ranks as the second most utilized web server globally, trailing only Apache in popularity.

The LEMP stack is a combination of four open-source technologies that are used in web development. These technologies include:

- Linux: The operating system that runs the web server.
- Nginx: The web server software that handles HTTP requests.
- MySQL: The relational database management system that stores the websiteâ€™s data.
- PHP: The programming language used to build dynamic web applications.


### How does the LEMP Stack work?

The LEMP stack operates by employing Nginx as its web server, responsible for receiving HTTP requests and directing them to the relevant PHP script. These PHP scripts generate responses, which are subsequently delivered back to the user through Nginx.

MySQL serves as the database management system for storing and organizing the websi
